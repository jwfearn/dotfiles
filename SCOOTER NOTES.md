# SCOOTER NOTES

- The `scooter` project is set up as an umbrella app, currently with two
sub-apps: `scooter` and `scooter_web`
- What else does the `scooter` app do?
- Would it make more sense to create separate `ad_conversion` app?
- Are these files used anymore? If not can we delete them?
    ad_conversion_producer.ex
